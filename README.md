// PROCESS TO EXECUTE
//Run the compiled executable file (EsgSurveyAutomation.exe) from the command line.
//Pass the path to the PDF file containing the survey responses as a command-line argument. For example:

//EsgSurveyAutomation.exe C:\path\to\survey_responses.pdf
//Output:

//The application will process the survey responses from the provided PDF file.
//It will output the sentiment analysis result, key phrases extracted from the survey responses, and answers to the survey questions to the console.
//Additionally, the processed data will be stored in Azure Blob Storage with the filename processed_survey_response.txt


//Replace the placeholder values (<YOUR_TEXT_ANALYTICS_ENDPOINT>, <YOUR_TEXT_ANALYTICS_API_KEY>, <YOUR_STORAGE_CONNECTION_STRING>, <YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME>) with your actual Azure service credentials and adjust the code as needed based on your specific requirements. Then, follow the steps mentioned earlier to run the code and obtain the output, which now includes answers to predefined survey questions based on the provided PDF file.
